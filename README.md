## BReview

This repository is a collection of reviews of the technical books which I read. It contains the notes and also some code from the book so that anyone reading it could recollect the information easily. This repository will be updated (may not be regular).

The books which I have read:
- **Beginning JavaScript - Third Edition** : Paul Wilton, Jeremy McPeak; Wrox Publication
